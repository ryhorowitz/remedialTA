  READ THESE COMMENTS AS A PART OF STEP TWO

  To manage switching among the different views in this application, 
  we have implemented a "view switcher" in the `App` component. 

  There are three key parts to the view switcher:
    1. The `view` property defined on the `App` component's `state`
    2. The `changeView` method defined on the `App` component
    3. The `renderView` method defined on the `App` component

  The value of the `view` property will determine which gets returned by the
  `renderView` method, which is invoked inside the `App` component's `render`. 
  You can set the initial value of `view` in the `App` component's `constructor`
  function, determining what view gets rendered "by default".

  If you haven't modified this code yet, the view switcher observes the following rules:
  - The default view is 'feed'
  - If the view is set to 'feed', the `<Feed>` component is displayed
  - If the view is set to any other value, the `<Post>` component is displayed
  - The `changeView` function should change the value of `view` in the `App` component's state.

  You'll make some refactors and additions to this view switcher throughout the
  next steps of the assessment. When you're ready, return to the README.
