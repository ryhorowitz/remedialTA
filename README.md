# The Technical Assessment

Ready to put your skills to the test and have some full-stack hacking fun? This assessment is like a day long solo sprint where you get to build a full stack JavaScript application using the skills and technologies you've worked with during the first half of the course. Expect to reinforce concepts and techniques you are familiar with and also to learn some new content.

## Before Starting

1. Confirm that all communication applications and tools are turned off, closed, put away
1. Fork this repo and clone it. Do not push your work any time during this assessment.
1. Before you begin work, open zoom, share your screen with zoom and then start recording your session.
1. Open the #technical-assessment Slack channel and keep it visible or return to it often for updates

## Guidelines

You must manage your time effectively to complete this assessment. This assessment will be evaluated as if it was a coding challenge given to you as part of a job application process. Not only will the functionality of your code be important, but also, the professionalism with which you write it. Consider the style and organization of your code. Make frequent commits with informative and consistent commit messages. Be professional and informative with your comments.

Each directory contains a prompt with work for you to complete, with instructions defined in their own README.

## Available resources

The ultimate goal of this assessment is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities as an engineer. Avoid anything that will obscure our ability and your ability to see your best efforts at work will undermine that goal.

* You **may not** use a scaffolding tool (e.g. Create-React-App, Yeoman, etc.) or starter repos unless specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** use any resources created at Hack Reactor by yourself, other students, or staff members
  * e.g. lectures, sprints, MVP, past assessments, side projects, notes, mentor assignments, etc.
* You **may** only use online resources specifically allowed in a prompt's README
* You **may not** copy and paste from available online resources

## Submitting Your Work

You will meet with your instruction team members in your zoom classroom to turn in your work.  If you finish early, reach out in the #technical-assessment channel and let the team know you would like to turn in your work.

To complete your technical assessment...

1. Make a final commit before the TA deadline.
1. Stop recording your screen and save your video file locally as `firstname-lastname-yyyymmdd`
    - NOTE: While the video is saving, proceed with the next steps.

1. Fill out the `closing_comments.txt` file.
1. Commit the changes to `closing_comments.txt` and `README.md`.
    - NOTE: This commit should only contain changes to these two files - no other changes are allowed
1. Join your instruction team in your cohort zoom for further instructions on submitting your work.
1. When the screen recording video has finished processing, copy all videos of your work to a location where it can be downloaded by your technical mentor and fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbm6L89vCRXEIFRV6oS-jSq_81yDhvF9nnOO8Niq8BdEGeCA/viewform) indicating that it's ready for download.
